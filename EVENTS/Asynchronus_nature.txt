Default javascript is a synchronus language and it is single threaded language

execution context : - execute one line of codd at a time
                  --  console by -> 1
                 -- console by -> 2
                 call stack and memory heap          
        
       each execution waits for the last one to complete before executing...


Blocking code vs non- blocking code

blocking code :--  block the flow of program --> read file synchronus
Non-blocking code ::-- does not block execution --> Read file Async


file reading is done through nodejs not by js coz  it has not so much power for 
// data file me written ho gaya and we have sent messsage that registeration succssufll in non- blocking code
