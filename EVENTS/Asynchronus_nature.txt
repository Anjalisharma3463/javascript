Default javascript is a synchronus language and it is single threaded language

execution context : - execute one line of codd at a time
                  --  console by -> 1
                 -- console by -> 2
                 call stack and memory heap          
        
       each execution waits for the last one to complete before executing...


Blocking code vs non- blocking code

blocking code :--  block the flow of program --> read file synchronus
Non-blocking code ::-- does not block execution --> Read file Async


file reading is done through nodejs not by js coz  it has not so much power for 
// data file me written ho gaya and we have sent messsage that registeration succssufll in non- blocking code

//real use of callback function make sensen in asynchronus function not in sunchronus..


APIs
Fetch API

all three are Asynschorus fn

settimeout 
fs.readfile
Fetch 


jab asynschronus function is counting time that is given to this to come in callback queue, so it will come only when stack is free. mtlb jab tak jo code neeche ka code chl rha ha tha vo puri thrh execute nahi ho jataaa.
